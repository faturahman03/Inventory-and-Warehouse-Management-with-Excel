# üì¶ Inventory & Warehouse Management Dashboard (Excel-Based)

## üß≠ Executive Summary
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing **Inventory & Warehouse Management** data using **Microsoft Excel** as the primary tool.  
The dataset, sourced from **Kaggle (open source)**, contains detailed records of products, suppliers, warehouse locations, stock levels, pricing, and turnover rates.  

The main objective is to provide **clear and actionable insights** regarding inventory performance ‚Äî such as identifying stock inefficiencies, turnover trends, and product status distribution ‚Äî to support better operational decision-making and stock optimization.

Through the development of an **interactive Excel dashboard** (utilizing Pivot Tables and Power Pivot), the analysis delivers both **quantitative summaries** and **visual insights**, enabling stakeholders to quickly monitor inventory health, assess stock risks, and prioritize replenishment activities.

## üíº Business Problem
Effective inventory management is crucial for maintaining operational efficiency, ensuring product availability, and minimizing holding costs.  
However, organizations often face challenges such as:
- Overstock situations that lead to high storage costs or product waste.
- Stockout issues that disrupt sales and customer satisfaction.
- Slow-moving inventory that ties up working capital.
- Inconsistent stock levels across multiple warehouses.

This project aims to address these common problems by analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) and creating a data-driven dashboard that highlights:
- **Total and average stock performance.**
- **Inventory turnover efficiency.**
- **Product expiration risk.**
- **Stock distribution across product categories and warehouses.**
- **Overall product status and availability.**

By turning raw data into actionable insights, this analysis helps business teams make informed decisions on **reorder planning, warehouse utilization, and inventory optimization**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
All data processing, cleaning, transformation, and visualization were conducted entirely using **Microsoft Excel** (including Power Query, Pivot Table, and Power Pivot).  
The workflow includes the following key steps:

### üßπ Data Cleaning & Transformation
- **Removed duplicates** based on `Product_ID` to ensure data integrity.  
- **Handled missing values**, where only one row contained null data, and addressed accordingly.  
- **Validated and corrected inconsistencies**, ensuring accuracy across numerical and categorical fields.  
- **Standardized data formats**, especially date columns, using **Power Query** for consistent time-based calculations.  
- **Created two new calculated fields:**
  - `expired_status` ‚Üí derived from `Last_Order_Date` and `Expiration_Date`, indicating whether a product is expired or still active.  
  - `total_stock` ‚Üí calculated as the sum of `Stock_Quantity` and `Reorder_Quantity`, representing the complete stock count per item.

### üìä Data Analysis & Visualization
Using **Pivot Table** and **Power Pivot**, the following metrics and visual dashboards were developed:
- **Summary Section:**
  - Total stock  
  - Average turnover rate  
  - Total expired products
- **Stock per Category:**  
  Bar chart showing total stock by product category.
- **Re-stock Needed:**  
  Identification of warehouses with the lowest stock levels (including *Bottom 10 Warehouses* insight).
- **Inventory Turnover:**  
  Listing of products with the lowest turnover rate and corresponding stock quantities.
- **Product Status Overview:**  
  Distribution of product status (Active, Discontinued, Backordered) and their percentage of total products.

These visual components are designed to provide **a holistic view of warehouse performance** and allow stakeholders to quickly identify critical areas requiring attention.
